# Newsletter-Signup
It's a single page website that looks pretty nice, and on the frontend it looks incredibly simple, but on the backend it's got some powerful functionality that allows to sign people up to a mailing list.
Once you click on Sign Up, if it was successful, you'll get taken to the success page, if it wasn't, you'll get a failure page. 
When it's successful, that data you entered into that collection box gets sent to a list on Mailchimp and you get added as a new subscriber.
